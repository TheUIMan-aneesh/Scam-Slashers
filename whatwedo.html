      <p>In 2022, The US Federal Trade Commission reported a consumer loss of almost 8.8 billion dollars to scams. This total was an increase of over 30% from the previous year. The majority of these losses are the results of online investment and imposter scams. Through fraudulent phone calls and social media networking, scammers are able to take advantage of consumer decisions to meet their needs.

As our society continues to grow alongside technology, consumers must make themselves more aware of the patterns and consequences of scams. Scam Slashers serves to continue this vision by educating communities on the dangers of scams. We believe all digital consumers have a responsibility to be technologically aware.
